      <h2>About <span>Hyemath Kashmir</span></h2>
      <p>
        Hyemath Kashmir is a non-governmental organization (NGO) registered
        under Indian Trusts Act and Niti Ayog that was born out of concern for
        the people during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our journey began as a small
        group of individuals who recognized the increased demand for Oxygen
        Cylinder and concentrators during the pandemic. We quickly realized that
        many people were struggling to access these life-saving devices due to
        financial constraints and lack of information. To address this issue, we
        established a network of people who were either renting their cylinders
        and concentrators or providing them for free. We used our network to
        connect people in need with these life-saving devices, and we
        successfully catered to hundreds of cases. Our aim was to help people in
        their time of need and make a positive impact on their lives. As we
        continued to provide support to people during the pandemic, we came
        across a new problem. We encountered people who were financially hit and
        didn't have monthly food supplies. We realized that access to food was
        as crucial as access to oxygen and we decided to expand our domain to
        include the delivery of food kits. We began providing food kits to those
        in need, and the number of cases started to increase rapidly. Since
        then, we have expanded our services to include blood donation and
        empowerment as well. We believe that access to healthcare is a
        fundamental right, and everyone should have the opportunity to receive
        medical assistance when they need it. Our organization is committed to
        providing support to those in need, and we believe that every little bit
        helps. We are grateful to our volunteers, donors, and partners who have
        helped us in our journey so far. With their support, we have been able
        to make a positive impact on the lives of many people. We are dedicated
        to continuing our work and expanding our services to reach even more
        people in need.
